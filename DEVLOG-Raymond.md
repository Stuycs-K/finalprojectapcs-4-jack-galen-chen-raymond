## Raymond Chen 

### 2025-05-25 - Started on the UI
~1 hr - Created basic grid and split up the screen into the equation bar on the left and the main grid

### 2025-05-26 - Optimized code
~1 hr - Made code for the grid more efficient, changed size of squares on grid to 100x100 to make coding easier, added the numbers onto the grid

### 2025-05-27 - Created function board
~ 1 hr - Created keyboard icon that moves position when clicked, finished function board that pops up with user click, buttons have symbols (not functional yet)

### 2025-05-28 - More functionality in Equation bar and Function bar
~ 2 hrs - Delete and enter on function bar can add and remove new equations, equation boxes can be selected/highlighted on the left, up/down arrow keys work to navigate around the equations, equations bar looks more like the real Desmos, split Main into two files for convenience

### 2025-05-29 - Streamlined code and functionality
~3 hrs - Made code for the grid (and to create the numbers on the grid) more efficient, created the feature to hide the equations bar and fullscreen the grid, may now be too slow to run so need to fix that

### 2025-05-30 - Added equations + more functions
~1.5 hrs - Finished fullscreen grid features + transitioning between fullscreen and halfscreen grid, worked on Galen's computer in class to implement graph()
~2 hrs - Implemented typing characters, graphing, deleting equations and deleting from equations, but still buggy (empty strings cause issues, the sketch tends to crash after a few actions, typing does not always work)

### 2025-06-01 - Fixing bugs + more functionality
~0.5 hr - Implemented typing on the function bar as inputs to the equations, and added symbols onto the buttons on the top right
~1.5 hr - Updated Prototype description and UML to reflect the minor changes made, bugfixed and tested to make sure the basic features work

### 2025-06-03 - Implemented additional features
~1.5 hr - Implemented colors, where each equation has a different color, and each equation's color can be changed by clicking on the circle next to each equation

### 2025-06-04 - Improved UI
~1 hr - Fixed spacing on the numbers on the grid, put an upper bound on the zoom out function, added better logos for UI

### 2025-06-05 - More UI Improvements
~1 hr - Added a cursor in so that different parts of the equation can be deleted
