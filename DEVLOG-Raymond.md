## Raymond Chen 

### 2025-05-25 - Started on the UI
~1 hr - Created basic grid and split up the screen into the equation bar on the left and the main grid

### 2025-05-26 - Optimized code
~1 hr - Made code for the grid more efficient, changed size of squares on grid to 100x100 to make coding easier, added the numbers onto the grid

### 2025-05-27 - Created function board
~ 1 hr - Created keyboard icon that moves position when clicked, finished function board that pops up with user click, buttons have symbols (not functional yet)

### 2025-05-28 - More functionality in Equation bar and Function bar
~ 2 hrs - Delete and enter on function bar can add and remove new equations, equation boxes can be selected/highlighted on the left, up/down arrow keys work to navigate around the equations, equations bar looks more like the real Desmos, split Main into two files for convenience

### 2025-05-29 - Streamlined code and functionality
~3 hrs - Made code for the grid (and to create the numbers on the grid) more efficient, created the feature to hide the equations bar and fullscreen the grid, may now be too slow to run so need to fix that

### 2025-05-30 - Added equations + more functions
~2 hrs - Finished fullscreen grid features + transitioning between fullscreen and halfscreen grid, worked on Galen's computer in class to implement graph()
