# IDEAS:

1. How do small scale social interactions become broadly observable patterns? To answer this question, we propose to to create a simulation of a social phenomenon that is regulated by a set of rules applicable to the individual. Examples of this we are considering include, opinion spread, neighborhood segregation and disease spread. This can also be modified to become a population ecology model, to model a real-life ecosystem (e.g. relationship between five organisms in a food chain). There will be graphs and models that can be displayed to show statistics and information about the model and about each individual human or organism (e.g. diversity, number of humans affected, chance of the condition spreading to any given human, etc.).

2. We propose to create a Synthesizer with a functional UI that allows the user to build unique sounds with choices of different wave types (Sine, Saw, Square) and oscillators. We will create a user friendly interface to allow the user to interact with the program through knobs and sliders. There will also be an option to play the music created.

3. We propose creating a replica of the graphing software Desmos. The left side of the screen will display the user's input, which will be processed into an accurate graph, displayed on the right. There will be options to color the graphs, zoom in/out, etc., as in the real Desmos.
