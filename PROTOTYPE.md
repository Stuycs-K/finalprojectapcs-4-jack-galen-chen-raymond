# Technical Details:

(CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

A description of your technical design. This should include: 
   
How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.

The user interface will replicate Desmos'. There will be a bar on the left where the user can input equations into the graphing calculator. There will be a bar on the bottom of the screen where symbols like the square root symbol and absolute value bars can be accessed. The majority of the screen will be taken up by the graph itself, and there will be buttons in the top right to zoom in and out of the graph. 

We hope to have a few other features as well. These include allowing the user to change the color of a graph, incorporating all the available functions in Desmos (such as sine, cosine, logarithms, etc.), allowing the user to manually change the scale and dimensions of the graph, and incorporating polar functions and the polar grid. We also hope to have the feature in Desmos where clicking on the graph can reveal the coordinates of the point that was clicked on. 

     
# Project Design

UML Diagrams and descriptions of key algorithms, classes, and how things fit together.


    
# Intended pacing:

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.
