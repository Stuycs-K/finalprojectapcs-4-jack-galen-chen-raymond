# Project Description

AP Computer Science Semester 2 pd. 4 \
Raymond Chen, Galen Jack \
The Desmos Duo \
This is a replica of the online graphing calculator Desmos. 

# Intended usage:

## Equations Bar (left side of screen)
Plus Sign Button (top left): Opens a menu where you can select to add a new expression into the equations bar, or add a new note into the equations bar.

Double Arrow Button (top right): Closes the equations bar to fullscreen the grid and any graphs, or opens the equation bar if the equations bar is closed.
- Closing the equations bar automatically closes the functions bar. 

Navigating and editing the equations:
- The equations are **automatically in y= notation**; y= does not need to be typed, only the other side of the equation with the variable x (e.g. x+5) can be typed.
- **Clicking on an equation** selects that equation (indicated by the equations slot being highlighted in blue) and edit that equation.
- **Clicking on the colored circle next to an equation** changes the color of that equation (in the order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, pink, black).
- The **up and down keys** change which equation you are currently selecting.
- The **left and right keys** move the cursor on the equation.
- The **return key** adds a new equation, with a randomized color.
- The **delete key** deletes the character of the equation directly to the left of the cursor (if there is one), or deletes the equation slot if there is no equation present.

## Functions Bar (bottom of screen)
Keyboard button (bottom left): Opens the function bar, which is closed by default, or closes the function bar if the bar is open. \ 
The **x button** inserts an *x* variable into the selected equation. \ 
The **y button** inserts a *y* variable into the selected equation. \
The **a^2 button** inserts a *^2* to square the preceding character to the cursor in the selected equation. \ 
The **a^b button** inserts a *^* symbol to allow the user to raise the preceding character to the cursor in the selected equation to a power. \
The **( button** inserts a right-facing parentheses in the selected equation. \ 
The **) button** inserts a left-facing parentheses in the selected equation. \
The **< button** inserts a greater-than symbol in the selected equation. \ 
The **> button** inserts a less-than symbol in the selected equation. \ 
The **|a| button** inserts an absolute value bar *|* in the selected equation. \
The **, button** inserts a comma in the selected equation. \
The **<= button** inserts a greater-than-or-equal-to symbol in the selected equation. \
The **>= button** inserts a less-than-or-equal-to symbol in the selected equation. \
The **color button** changes the color of the selected equation's graph (in the order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, pink, black). \
The **reset button** empties the current equation, getting rid of all characters. \
The **√ button** inserts a square root symbol into the selected equation. \
The **π button** inserts a pi symbol in the selected equation. \
The **e key on the keyboard** inserts Euler's constant into the selected equation. \
The **1 button** inserts a 1 into the selected equation. \
The **2 button** inserts a 2 into the selected equation. \
The **3 button** inserts a 3 into the selected equation. \
The **4 button** inserts a 4 into the selected equation. \ 
The **5 button** inserts a 5 into the selected equation. \
The **6 button** inserts a 6 into the selected equation. \ 
The **7 button** inserts a 7 into the selected equation. \
The **8 button** inserts a 8 into the selected equation. \
The **9 button** inserts a 9 into the selected equation. \
The **0 button** inserts a 0 into the selected equation. \
The **. button** inserts a decimal point into the selected equation. \
The **= button** inserts an equals sign into the selected equation. \
The **/ button** inserts a division sign into the selected equation. \
The *** button** inserts a multiply sign into the selected equation. \
The **- button** inserts a minus sign into the selected equation. \
The **+ button** inserts a plus sign into the selected equation. \
The **left arrow key** moves the cursor to the left in the selected equation. \
The **right arrow key** moves the cursor to the right in the selected equation. \
The **delete key** deletes the character of the equation directly to the left of the cursor (if there is one), or deletes the equation slot if there is no equation present. \
The **return key** adds a new equation into the equation slot. \

*All keys that can be inputted into equations via the functions bar can be inputted from the physical keyboard as well.*
*Notes support all keys, including the alphabet (letters A-Z), numbers, and symbols.*

## Buttons on the Right Side of the Screen
The **reset button** resets the zoom on the grid to the default zoom (100px = 2 units). \
The **+ button** zooms in on the grid (the maximum zoom is 100px = 1 unit). \
The **- button** zooms out on the grid (the minimum zoom is 100px = 16384 units). \
