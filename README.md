# Project Description

AP Computer Science Semester 2 pd. 4 \
Raymond Chen, Galen Jack \
The Desmos Duo \
This is a replica of the online graphing calculator Desmos. 

# Intended usage:

## Equations Bar (left side of screen)
Plus Sign Button (top left): Opens a menu where you can select to add a new expression into the equations bar, or add a new note into the equations bar
Double Arrow Button (top right): Closes the equations bar to fullscreen the grid and any graphs, or opens the equation bar if the equations bar is closed 

Navigating and editing the equations:
- The equations are **automatically in y= notation**; y= does not need to be typed, only the other side of the equation with the variable x (e.g. x+5) can be typed.
- **Clicking on an equation** allows you to select that equation (indicated by the equations slot being highlighted in blue) and edit that equation.
- The **up and down keys** change which equation you are currently selecting.
- The **left and right keys** move the cursor on the equation.
- The **return key** adds a new equation.
- The **delete key** deletes the character of the equation directly to the left of the cursor (if there is one), or deletes the equation slot if there is no equation present.
