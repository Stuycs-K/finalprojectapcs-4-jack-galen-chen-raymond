# Project Description

AP Computer Science Semester 2 pd. 4 \
Raymond Chen, Galen Jack \
[group name] \
This is a replica of the online graphing calculator Desmos. 

# Intended usage:

The user interface will replicate Desmos'. There will be a bar on the left where the user can input equations into the graphing calculator. There will be a bar on the bottom of the screen where symbols like the square root symbol and absolute value bars can be accessed. The majority of the screen will be taken up by the graph itself, and there will be buttons in the top right to zoom in and out of the graph. \

We hope to have a few other features as well. These include allowing the user to change the color of a graph, incorporating all the available functions in Desmos (such as sine, cosine, logarithms, etc.), allowing the user to manually change the scale and dimensions of the graph, and incorporating polar functions and the polar grid. We also hope to have the feature in Desmos where clicking on the graph can reveal the coordinates of the point that was clicked on.
